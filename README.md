# SCAID
Establishing a meta-platform for discovering molecular targets for disease treatment by building a multi-layered immune disease single-cell map

The purpose of this project is constructing large scale and comprehensive map of single cell multiomics for understanding (auto)immne disease.

Many autoimmune disease have the disease-specific signuture but they have common features. 

To make sure what is the common feature and specific feature, many groups construct single cell atlas.

However, most studies are limited to the European or Amerian population.
