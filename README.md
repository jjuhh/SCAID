# SCAID
Establishing a meta-platform for discovering molecular targets for disease treatment by building a multi-layered immune disease single-cell map

The purpose of this project is constructing large scale and comprehensive map of single cell multiomics for understanding (auto)immne disease.
Many autoimmune disease have the disease-specific signuture but they have common features. To make sure what is the common feature and specific feature, many groups construct single cell atlas. However, most studies are limited to the European or Amerian population.
To make East Asian autoimmune disease atlas, we start to construct "SCAID". 

Our study subjects were a total of 16 autoimmune diseases. In addition, 10X genomics 5' seq (TCR/BCR) for PBMC samples, and 10X genomics 3' seq, snATAC-seq, and spatial transcriptome for tissue samples are also planned. At least 10 samples per disease will be archived and will be profiling within three years.

The most important part of this project is the disease-wide data integration and how to integrate other types of data. Since the characteristics of data such as scRNA, snATAC, spatial, and TCR/BCR are very different, this part will be the most important and difficult part. However, since many tools and algorithms are currently emerging in this field, we will overcome them by applying various methods.
Finally, we will provide advanced ananlysis, which is not yet provided by other atlas. Biologists who are not familiar with BI are expected to gain biological insight by using "SCAID".
